# state_map
This script creates state map of US using Python and GeoPandas. 
Two states, Alaska and Hawaii has been removed from the map.

Requires shape file. Though it looks like we are using only the .shp file, all files needs to me loaded as GeoPandas take information from all files. 

The script plots a full state map and adds other layer above it.
The states of choices can be saved in a list and those states can be plotted as required. 
Here I have plotted the states I have visited in different years.
